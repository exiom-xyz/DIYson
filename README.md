Components for making the DIYson lamp. Learn more on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxvXWYcOlmhRFvZ_ISP8g).

All designs are likely (probably guaranteed) to change. 3D models are updated regularly for education and experimentation but will almost certainly be updated, replaced, or removed in the future.

### NOTICE [MAY 2025]
There have been lots of hardware updates over the past few months (especially in the electronics department). I would suggest holding off on buying anything from the parts list until the project is wrapped and the BOM is updated. Let me know if you have any specific questions about any components in the meantime.
